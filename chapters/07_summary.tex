\section{Summary}
The goal of this dissertation was to implement a telemetric-only Kubernetes
scheduler using the theory behind PRONTO as a spring-board. I based the design
of the scheduler behind PRONTO because of its federated nature and its use of
contention-based metrics.


This dissertation resembles little to what was in the Project Proposal, and I
feel this tells a lot about this project. A telemetric-only Kubernetes scheduler
was a novel and inetresting
presented an interesting and novel
