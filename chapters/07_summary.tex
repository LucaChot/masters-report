\section{Summary}
This dissertation set out to explore the application of \textsc{Pronto}'s
underlying theory to a Kubernetes scheduler. \textsc{Pronto}'s ability to
efficiently aggregate and process telemetry produced across a datacenter
addressed the limitations of telemetry-focused schedulers which aimed to reduce
the reliance on user-provided resource requests. However, the dynamic nature of
Kubernetes necessitated a novel comparable and reservable signal.

The project successfully achieved its objectives by proposing \textsc{Carico}, a
federated, asynchronous, and memory-limited scoring algorithm that explicitly
accounts for communication latency, a key challenge in real-world Kubernetes
environments. A significant contribution was the novel application of Federated
Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD) on non-mean-centered data to build a local
model of recent resource usage, providing a unique interpretation of resource
utilisation direction and magnitude. This led to the development of a
continuous, comparable, and reservable capacity signal, expressed in terms of
Pod units, which allows for robust reservation mechanisms and dynamic adaptation
to changing workloads.

The comprehensive evaluation of the \textsc{Carico} prototype within a Kubernetes cluster
yielded several key findings. \textsc{Carico} demonstrated comparable Job
Completion times to the default kube-scheduler, crucially without requiring
explicit Pod resource requests. More significantly, it consistently achieved
substantially lower Pod Completion times and improved workload isolation,
highlighting its effectiveness as a Quality of Service (QoS) scheduler. The
evaluation also confirmed \textsc{Carico}'s low overhead, estimated at approximately 2\%,
making it a practical solution for real-world deployments. These results,
combined with \textsc{Carico} portable nature, highlight its potential to
significantly enhance scheduling efficiency and resource utilisation in
Kubernetes and other orchestration systems by providing a more adaptive and
performance-aware approach.

% What is the impact of this paper

\section{Future Work}
The insights gained from \textsc{Carico}'s development and evaluation open
several promising avenues for future research. One significant direction
involves exploring \textsc{Carico}'s applicability in other scheduling
environments where explicit resource requests are either impractical or
unavailable. The core design principles of \textsc{Carico}, particularly its
federated, asynchronous, and memory-limited nature, coupled with its ability to
derive meaningful capacity signals from telemetry, are not intrinsically tied
to Kubernetes and could be adapted for diverse scheduling challenges beyond
container orchestration.

Further research could also focus on \textsc{Carico}'s implementation. A
potential direction is to expand \textsc{Carico}'s metric range beyond CPU and
memory with network I/O, disk I/O, or GPU utilisation, to offer a more holistic
and accurate representation of workloads' resource utilisation. Additionally, it
is crucial to evaluate \textsc{Carico}'s performance on physical machines rather
than VMs, as hypervisors can mask certain performance degradation effects, making
CPU utilisation alone an unreliable indicator of true contention. This would
investigate the performance impact from using telemetry data that is more
directly representative of underlying hardware contention and actual performance
degradation.
